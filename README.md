#  Hotel Performance Analytics Dashboard
## Project Objective
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard to track and analyze key performance metrics across multiple hotel properties. The dashboard aggregates and visualizes data related to revenue, room occupancy, booking platforms, and customer feedback across various cities and room types.
## Dataset Used
- <a href = "https://github.com/shakti-patil/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/dim_date.csv">Dates Dataset</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/shakti-patil/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/dim_hotels.csv">Hotels Dataset</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/shakti-patil/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/dim_rooms.csv">Rooms Dataset</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/shakti-patil/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/fact_aggregated_bookings.csv">Aggregated bookings Dataset</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/shakti-patil/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/fact_bookings.csv">Bookings Dataset</a>

##Questions(KPIs)
- What is the total revenue generated across all properties?
-How much revenue does each property contribute?
-What is the Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)
-What is the average occupancy rate across all properties?
-How does occupancy vary between weekdays and weekends?
-What is the total number of Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
-How many rooms were actually booked (DBRN) and utilized (DURN)
-What is the average ADR (Average Daily Rate) by property and booking platform?
-What percentage of revenue comes from Luxury vs Business room categories?

## Process
-Data Collection
-Handled missing values, date formatting, and inconsistent property names.
-Created relationships between tables
-Designed the visual layout using KPI cards, line charts, pie charts, bar graphs, and detailed tables to display performance metrics in an intuitive and readable format.
-Implemented filters and slicers for city, room type, and time range (weekly view). Enabled drill-down functionality for property-level insights and platform comparisons.
-Published the dashboard to the BI platform with scheduled data refreshes.

##Project Insights
-Opportunity to shift focus toward high-yield platforms.
-Indicates stronger performance or demand in business-class offerings.
-Weekly trends show relatively stable ADR and RevPAR, but fluctuations in occupancy % suggest periodic demand shifts
-Several properties maintain high average ratings (above 4.3), reflecting good customer satisfaction and service quality.

## Final Conclusion
The Hotel Performance Analytics Dashboard successfully delivers a unified and data-driven view of hotel operations across multiple cities and properties. By integrating key performance indicators such as revenue, RevPAR, ADR, occupancy rate, and customer ratings, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to monitor trends, evaluate property performance, and make informed strategic decisions.The analysis reveals that while overall revenue and ADR are strong, there is room to improve occupancy rates and maximize realization percentages. Platform-specific insights highlight opportunities to optimize distribution channels, while high cancellation rates suggest a need for improved booking policies or guest engagement.
